Original description
--------------------

Adds two recipies to the game. With level 8 Carpentry and a Screwdriver, you can take a door knob and alter it to match any key so it can be locked and unlocked with the key. Or you can do the opposite and alter a key to match a doorknob that already has a lock.
Which means you can make multiple keys for one door knob and or multiple door knobs for one key.

TsT's changes
-------------

* Add version info to be used by [pz-tiny_avc](https://github.com/tst2005/pz-tiny_avc/)
* Some minor fixes (indentation, clean dead lua code)
